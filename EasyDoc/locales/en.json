It is allocated when the database manager starts (db2start) and released when the database manager stops (db2stop). The size of this area is automatically controlled by DB2.",
    "AppGMText": "Each database instance has its own global memory area, which includes multiple application heaps. An application heap is allocated for each application that connects to the database. The memory amount for each application can be limited by the 'applheapsz' parameter, and the total memory for all applications can be limited by the 'appl_memory' parameter. The diagram shows multiple application heaps, supporting multiple simultaneous connections, with the maximum number determined by the max_connections parameter.",
